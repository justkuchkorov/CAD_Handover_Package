# CAD Data Management Simulation

This repository showcases practical, self-initiated projects designed to simulate real-world CAD data management tasks. Inspired by the responsibilities of a CAD Data Management, the projects demonstrate my proficiency in CAD design, Excel automation, data tracking, Power BI visualization, and documentation.
